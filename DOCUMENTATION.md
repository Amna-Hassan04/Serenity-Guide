## Code Explanation

### Main Features and How They Are Implemented

1. **Meditation Sessions**
    - The `meditation.js` file handles the various guided meditations. It includes a timer, user progress, and audio playback functionality.
    - The sessions are stored as JSON objects and dynamically rendered based on user selection.

2. **Mood Tracker**
    - The `moodTracker.js` script handles user input related to mood, stores it in local storage, and displays it on the dashboard.
    - We use the `Chart.js` library to render a graph showing the mood data.

3. **Breathing Exercises**
    - The breathing exercises are handled using the `breathing.js` module. It implements a basic animation for the inhale and exhale process, guiding the user through visual cues.
    - Timers and event listeners are used to start/stop the breathing session.
