## 1. Project Overview
The Anxiety Relief Platform is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help users manage anxiety and mental health. This app leverages Anthropicâ€™s Claude API to deliver personalized tips based on user input, along with features like relaxation exercises, visualizations, and mental health-related games.



## 2. Features

AI-Powered Recommendations: Integrates Claude AI to offer personalized anxiety management advice.
Interactive UI: Features relaxation exercises, games, breathing techniques, and daily challenges.
Data Visualization: Shows the effectiveness of calming activities through interactive charts.
Accessible Design: User-friendly interface with custom styling for a calming user experience.



## 3. Libraries and Dependencies

The application requires the following Python libraries:

streamlit: Builds the app's user interface.
plotly.express: Creates interactive data visualizations.
requests: Fetches data for animations and external API interactions.
anthropic: Interacts with Claude AI for personalized recommendations.
streamlit_lottie: Integrates Lottie animations.
pandas: Handles dataframes for data visualization.
base64: Encodes images and animations.

To install the dependencies:

```bash

pip install streamlit pandas plotly requests anthropic streamlit_lottie
```

## 4. Claude AI Integration

Claude API is used to provide tailored anxiety management recommendations based on user input, such as mood, stress level, and recent events.

Example usage:

```bash
client = anthropic.Client(api_key=claude_api_key)

def anxiety_management_guide(mood, feeling_description, stress_level, recent_events):
    message = client.messages.create(
        prompt=f"User's mood: {mood}, stress level: {stress_level}. Recent events: {recent_events}",
        model="claude-v1"
    )
    return message['completion']
```

## 5. Application Structure

## 5.1 Navigation Menu
The app has three main sections:

Home: Breathing exercises, personalized tips, and mental health resources.
Calm Space: Includes interactive tools like daily challenges, soothing sounds, and mood-boosting games.
About & Feedback: Information about the app, the team, and a feedback form for users.
```bash
selected = option_menu(
    menu_title="Main Menu", options=["Home", "Calm Space", "About & Feedback"]
)
```

## 5.2 Home Page
The Home section includes a form for users to submit their mood and stress level. Claude AI provides personalized suggestions based on their input.

Example code for the home page:

```bash
if selected == "Home":
    st.title("Welcome to the Anxiety Relief Platform")
    if st.button('Start Guided Breathing'):
        st.balloons()
        st.write("Inhale deeply... Exhale slowly... Repeat.")
```
        
## 5.3 Calm Space
In the Calm Space section, users can choose activities like meditation, yoga, and journaling, and receive instructions.

```bash
if selected == "Calm Space":
    st.header("Calm Space: Select Your Activity")
    selected_activity = st.selectbox(
        "Choose a relaxation activity", ["Meditation", "Yoga", "Breathing"]
    )
```
    
## 5.4 Data Visualization
Users can view data on the effectiveness of various anxiety-reducing activities through a bar chart created using Plotly.

```bash
data = {
    'Activity': ['Meditation', 'Yoga', 'Breathing', 'Journaling', 'Music'],
    'Calmness_Level': [85, 78, 90, 75, 88]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
fig = px.bar(df, x='Activity', y='Calmness_Level', title="Calmness Levels by Activity")
st.plotly_chart(fig)
```

## 6. Custom Styling

The app uses custom CSS for an enhanced user experience, such as animated backgrounds and styled buttons.

```bash
st.markdown("""
    <style>
    [data-testid="stAppViewContainer"] > .main {
        background: linear-gradient(90deg, #f3ec78, #af4261);
        padding-top: 10px;
    }
    </style>
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)
```
